The goal of this repo:
- Build a practical understanding of RFT for LLMs  
- Implement GRPO components step-by-step  
- Run clean, reproducible experiments  
- Compare reward strategies and policy updates  

## Structure
- `notes/` – Concept summaries from each lesson  
- `notebooks/` – Hands-on experiments  
- `src/` – GRPO implementation  
- `experiments/` – Configs + results for each experiment  

## Setup
